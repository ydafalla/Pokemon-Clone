# Pokemon-Clone
The goal of this project to to implement the Pokemon Clone game. The game consists of one player that plays against the computer. The player chooses a team of six pokemons and gets to pick the type of each of his pokemons and the order he wants to play his pokemons. The computer then generates a random team of pokemons to compete against the player pokemons. The rules of the game are as follows: A fire pokemon beats the grass pokemon and the water pokemon beats the fire pokemon and the grass pokemon beats the water pokemon. A track of high scores for a team is generated and saved to the file. The high scores are saved to the file in descending order.
